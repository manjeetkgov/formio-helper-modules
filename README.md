## Form.io widget

## How does it work?

- Assets:

- Paint layout references metadata scheme (used by Agency authors) and values exist on page as properties of form.io object. An example of these assets are backed up under /matrix-assets-examples/
- src/index.js is attached to form loader partial (footer extra)
- src/style.css is attached to header scripts partial (header extras)
- Run 'npm i' which will use postinstall to create /dist/ version

## Optional:

- TO DO: Setup gitbridge

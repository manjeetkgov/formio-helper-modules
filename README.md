## Form.io widget

## How does it work?

- Assets:

- Paint layout references metadata scheme (used by Agency authors) and values exist on page as properties of form.io object
- index.js is attached to form loader (footer extra)
- style.css is attached to header scripts (header extras)

## Optional:

- Run parcel to minify a build under /dist/
- TO DO: Setup gitbridge
